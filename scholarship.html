          <p>Every year, Multnomah Anglers and Hunters is proud to present six students pursuing degrees in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences at Oregon State University with a scholarship to help fund their studies.  These students are building careers in managing and conserving the fish, wildlife, and habitats that we work to protect, and we are honored to have been a part of this tradition for over 70 years.  The scholarship program is funded by the generosity of our members and donors like you!</p><p></p><p></p>
          <p>Our scholarships are dedicated to the memory of special MA&H members who worked to make this program such an amazing success.</p>
