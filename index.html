          <p>Multnomah Anglers & Hunters is Oregon's oldest sportsmen's organization, the third oldest sportsmen's organization in the United States, and the longest continuously running sportsmen's organization west of New York.  Established January 5, 1883, as the Multnomah Rod & Gun Club, we have spent the last 137 years supporting wildlife conservation and education efforts for the benefit of sportsmen and all citizens of Oregon.  We are a registered non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.</p>
